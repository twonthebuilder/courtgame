# Pocket Court

**An LLM-adjudicated legal strategy game where every case is unique.**

---

## What Is This?

Pocket Court is a courtroom simulator that uses AI to create procedurally generated legal cases with emergent difficulty. You play as defense or prosecution, strike jurors, file pre-trial motions, present closing arguments, and receive verdicts from an AI judge and jury whose biases affect the outcome.

**No two cases are the same.** Judge philosophies, jury compositions, and evidence combinations create thousands of possible scenarios.

---

## Core Mechanics

### **1. Jury Selection (Voir Dire)**
- 8 jurors in the pool, each with hidden biases
- Strike 2 jurors strategically (prosecution strikes 2 as well)
- Final jury of 4-6 people with varying sympathies

### **2. Pre-Trial Motions**
- File motions to suppress evidence or dismiss charges
- Judge rules based on their judicial philosophy (textualist, reformer, etc.)
- Successful motions set up your trial strategy
- **Weight: 40% of final score**

### **3. Trial Arguments**
- Present closing arguments to judge + jury (or just judge in bench trials)
- Judge scores legal soundness (30% weight)
- Jury scores persuasiveness (30% weight)
- Both audiences must be convinced

### **4. Verdict**
- Judge delivers ruling + detailed opinion
- Jury explains their reasoning (in jury trials)
- Scores 100+ unlock legendary achievements
- Cases are saved as a "living docket" you can share

## Difficulty Modes

- **Silly (Fictional jurisdiction):** Absurdist cases, generous scoring, fun achievements
- **Normal (USA/Canada):** Everyday disputes, realistic scoring, procedural focus
- **Nuance (USA/Canada):** Complex felonies, strict judges, moral ambiguity

---

## Why It's Different

**Most legal games:**
- Have predetermined solutions (Phoenix Wright)
- Are educational tools, not games (law school sims)
- Lack strategic depth (press button to object)

**Pocket Court:**
- Every case is procedurally generated with unique facts, evidence, and witnesses
- Judge philosophies create different win conditions (textualist ≠ reformer)
- Jury psychology matters (strike the insurance adjuster, keep the sympathetic teacher)
- Multi-phase optimization (pre-trial success enables trial dominance)
- You learn real legal concepts without realizing it

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (single-file architecture, will be modularized)
- **AI:** **For now** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (case generation, adjudication, deliberation)
- **State:** React hooks only (no localStorage/sessionStorage)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + custom animations. Global styles live in `src/index.css`, and component-specific styles should be co-located instead of using a monolithic `App.css`.
